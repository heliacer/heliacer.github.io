`I'm a full-stack Developer with 4 years of coding experience.
Currently studying at KUS Gymnasium in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Switzerland.
I'm passionate about learning new technologies and honing my skills. ðŸ˜„\n
I go by the alias Heliacer,
a name I created purely for its uniqueness, randomness, and the fact that it's easy to remember.`;

export const frontend_expertise = 
`Frontend development is where I really shine, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
React and Vite.js are my preferred tools for rapid development.
While still mastering TypeScript, I've already integrated it seamlessly into my React projects.`;

export const backend_expertise =
`On the backend, I specialize in Node.js and I'm delving into the world of Next.js with enthusiasm.
Python is my go-to language, especially for projects involving API wrappers.
Familiar with database management using IndexedDB SQL and SQLite3, with a penchant for client-side data storage solutions like IndexedDB.
Currently expanding my skill set with Rust and exploring Electron and Tauri for future projects.`;

export const history1 = 
`It all started when I was a young pupil, attending a Scratch workshop at school.
I was hooked, creating my account, fox_creations, and diving into the world of visual block programming.
Instead of gaming, Scratch became my fixation, leading me to gain over 400 followers and create loads of games.`;

export const history2 =
`A year later, I got into Python, and started dabbling in digital art for UI and logo designs.
I also started with Discord, creating my own server and apps, mainly for organizing in-game competitions,
as a self-taught coder, learning from online resources and experimenting with new ideas.
This period was crucial in shaping my coding style and problem-solving skills.\n
I got curious once about web development and had this wild idea for a Discord app dashboard.
with no clue about hosting costs or GitHub, but I pushed through, learning frontend and backend development along the way.
It continued with frameworks like React and Next.js, and I even built a website for my school's student council.
The about me website you see here is my first React project, and I'm proud of how far I've come. ðŸ˜Š
Nowadays, I'm still on this journey, always looking to level up my skills and become a better developer than I was yesterday..`;
