export const history_start = `
It all started when I was a young pupil, attending a Scratch workshop at school.
I was hooked, creating my account, fox_creations, and diving into the world of visual block programming.
Instead of gaming, Scratch became my fixation, leading me to gain over 400 followers and create loads of games.
`;

export const history_journey = `
A year later, I got into Python, rebranded myself, and started dabbling in digital art for UI and logo designs.
I also ventured into Discord, creating my own server and bots, mainly for organizing in-game competitions.
`;


export const history_present = `
Then, I got curious about web development and had this wild idea for a Discord bot dashboard.
I had no clue about hosting costs or GitHub, but I pushed through, learning frontend and backend development along the way.
It continued with frameworks like React and Next.js, and I even built a website for my school's student council.
The about me website you see here is my first React project, and I'm proud of how far I've come. ðŸ˜Š
Nowadays, I'm still on this journey, always looking to level up my skills and become a better developer than I was yesterday..
